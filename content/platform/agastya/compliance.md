				<h1>Increase your compliance.</h1>
				<p class="intro-para"><strong>There is no plug-and-play solution to being compliant with the various accessibility regulations around the world</strong>, but Agastya increases your compliance with these requirements by telling you what to fix.</p>
				<p>Agastya's feature Dai11y adds daily automated accessibility audits for your website. A bot visits your website every day and runs an automated accessibility audit. This will not catch all accessibility issues, but will help you find important problems like missing alternate text.</p>
